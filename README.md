cd to client and 
run 'npm install' then run 'npm start' command on the client folder
cd to server
and run 'npm install' then 'npm run dev' command on the server folder
remember you have to do run both of the command and then the app will run
The server runs on http://localhost:4000/
and client normally runs on http://localhost:3000/ but it can also run on other ports also but the port of server is fixed as it is mentioned in the code so make sure that no other app is running on port 4000.
